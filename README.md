# About me
> Hey there! I'm Abby and am currently seeking new career opportunities. I've had some incredible tech contract opportunities, was recently immersed in the R&D, grants, and marketing side of Web3, and would like to continue contributing to a team striving to make a positive impact. While I'll let [my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omGv3SydPx0UqwKYYUMIUq1jV8TeTsCu/view?usp=share_link) and the highlights below speak for themselves, here's a little more about me:
>  *  I _love_ **learning** new things. I'm currently learning:
>    *  **Coding** - I'm re-learning JavaScript so I can learn Eth development and Git, and become more efficient in GitHub.
>    *  **Digital drawing** - I'm teaching myself digital illustration and painting techniques
>    *  **Web3** - Yes this is a blanket term, but I'm working on becoming more well-rounded in my industry knowledge. 
>  *  I'm **creative**. I tend to think of innovative solutions, and also love art. While photography is my passion, you can view some of my paintings and drawings [here](https://www.instagram.com/asilin_art/).
>  *  I plan on **relocating** within the year and am flexible about location.
